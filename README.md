# Dodgers
Hey, this is a game I built on my own by using PyGame!
I built it in on a web-based IDE, and transferred over the code here.
This was is the first game with graphics that I built, and I learned a lot about pixels, objects, and collision.
I'm hoping to create more advanced games in the near future with this experience under my belt!
